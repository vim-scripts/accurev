                                                                       *accurev*
                       AccuRev Integration for Vim
                            v1.1.1 - 2009/08/18

  AccuRev is a leading Software Configuration & Change Management (SCCM)
  system that enables massive, parallel software development across local
  and distributed geographic boundaries.  If you develop software and need
  to manage multiple releases, product variants, or teams of local or
  remote developers, then AccuRev is for you.  See more at www.accurev.com.

  AccuRev was once a CLI-only tool and has since included incredibly powerful
  visualization tools such as the StreamBrowser.  Yet, for the CLI junkies in the
  crowd, the AccuRev CLI continues to remain a powerful and rich interface
  for pounding out software and sharing changes with the rest of your team.
  Most Vim users tend to be CLI-users and a tight integration with Vim means
  your fingers don't leave the keyboard, you can share your changes ealier,
  your software can stay as up-to-date as possible, and your productivity
  is ultimately Vim-proved.

  This plugin continues to be developed out of necessity and is used
  almost daily by the author.  Be sure to read more of the
  interesting |accurev-history|.

  See the |accurev-maintainer| for contact information.

About
                                                                *accurev-about*

  This plugin is written entirely out of personal necessity.  Naturally,
  this means that the format for user interaction, direction for buffer splits,
  key mappings, etc. are based largely on personal preference rather than
  democratic consensus or user studies.  That being said, I've used Vim
  for 10+ years, prefer my hands to stay on the keyboard, and strongly desire
  software usability that just-makes-sense.  I hope it all makes sense to you!

  The general usability philosophy is centered around the ability to work
  in the context of multiple, concurrent buffers/windows, very similar to a
  GUI-based IDE.  Initially, a single buffer is opened for a file.  As you
  start viewing history, doing diffs, running updates, etc., all of these
  activities are present in their own inline windows.  Depending on the size of
  your screen, you can have as many windows as you like.  The plugin will search
  for and re-use existing windows - so running update a few times throughout
  the day will display in the same window; same for history, info, etc.
  Ideally, the single vim session will create an accurev context (or nature)
  that lets you interact with AccuRev all without leaving Vim.


===============================================================================
Requirements
                                                         *accurev-requirements*

  This plugin requires Vim version 7.0+.  For the curious, the following 7.x
  features are used:

      List          - ordered list of items
      Dictionary    - associative array of items
      FuncRef       - reference to a function
      string()      - string representation of a variable/datastruct
      :let ops      - using +=/-=/.= for incrementing variables
      add()         - used to append to a list
      getbufline()  - get a list of lines from a buffer
      has_key()     - test for key entry in a Dictionary
      join()        - join items from a List into a string

  In addition, the following options are required to be compiled into Vim.
  Most standard binary builds of Vim should have them enabled.  To see which
  options your Vim currently has, type ':version'

      +autocmd       = needed for event handling
      +modify_fname  = needed for parsing filenames and paths
      +statusline    = needed for showing file status'
      +reltime       = needed for showing command timing stats
      +diff          = needed for embedded diffing/merging
      +menu          = needed for console menus (e.g. <F4>)
      +listcmds      = needed for buffer looping


===============================================================================
Installation
                                                         *accurev-installation*

  Installing the AccuRev SCM plugin for Vim is easy.
  
  NOTE: Be sure you have already installed the AccuRev client
        (www.accurev.com/download) and it is in your PATH.

  0. Download - obtain the plugin from any of these sites:

                  * vim4accurev.com         [stable/beta releases]
                  * vim.org --> scripts     [stable releases]

  1. Install - unpack archive _directly_ in your vim runtime path.

                     Unix: $HOME/.vim
                  Windows: %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles

               Check that /plugin/accurev.vim and /doc/accurev.txt exist.

  2. Setup   - Install help documentation by launching Vim and executing:

                     Unix: :helptags ~/.vim/doc
                  Windows: :helptags ~\vimfiles\doc

               Verify the setup by typing ':help accurev' within Vim.

  3. Verify  - Open a file within a local AccuRev workspace.  By default
               the plugin will load and prompt you to login to accurev
               (unless you are already logged in).  You should see a
               statusline starting with AccuRev and showing the file status
               in AccuRev, e.g. (backed).

               NOTE: the plugin loads only if 'accurev' executable is in PATH

  With the plugin installed, see the |accurev-tutorial| to get started.
  Check |accurev-troubleshooting| if you encounter any installation problems.


===============================================================================
3-min Tutorial, for the Impatient
                                                             *accurev-tutorial*
  
  This tutorial assumes the following:
  
    Computer  - Your computer is ON, running Unix or Windows, and not on fire.
    Software  - The AccuRev client is installed locally (accurev.com/download)
    Path      - 'accurev' client binary is in your PATH
    Plugin    - You have installed ~this~ Vim plugin for AccuRev
    Depot     - You have an AccuRev depot populated with source code
    Workspace - Your current working directory is an AccuRev workspace

  See |accurev-installation| to complete the above if necessary.

  Start the timer....

    0.  Logout of accurev to start fresh, ('$accurev logout' from CLI)

    1.  'cd' to anywhere in your AccuRev workspace
        -- run '$accurev info' on CLI to confirm directory is a workspace

    2.  Create a -new- file using vim.  You will be prompted to login to AccuRev.
        -- Verify the default status bar says "[New]"

    3.  Add content on *line 1* then save (':w')
        -- Verify the accurev status bar says "(external)"

    4.  ADD the file to version control ('\a')
        -- Verify the accurev status bar says "(kept)(member)"

    5.  Make some more changes on *line 1* and *line 2*... but don't save yet!
        -- Notice the accurev status bar has a [+] sign indicating the buffer is modified

    6.  Now save the file (':w')
        -- Verify the accurev status bar says "(modified)(member)"

    7.  Diff your changes to the recently added version ('\dr')
        -- Verify that vimdiff shows the differences

    8.  Exit diff mode ('\dx')

    9.  KEEP your changes ('\k')
        -- Verify the accurev status bar says "(kept)(member)"

   10.  Make some more changes, and save them (':w'), and KEEP them ('\k')

   11.  View the HISTORY ('\h').  Verify previous transactions.  Exit history, (':q')

   12.  Annotate/blame the file ('\b') to view per-txn history and comments.
        Navigate to different lines ('j/k') changed above and view each commit
        comment ('l' or <space>).  Exit annotate, (':q')

   13.  PROMOTE your file ('\p')
        -- Verify the accurev status bar says "(backed)"
        -- Note: If AccuRev issue tracking is turned on, you'll need to enable it in the plugin.

   14.  Logout of AccuRev ('\x')
        -- Verify that the statusbar no longer says "AccuRev...."

  Finished!.  Congratulations! You just added a new file to version control, 
  reviewed multiple changes with inline diff, created and viewed file history,
  and finally promoted and shared it with others.

  Tip: Lets promote multiple pending files all at once.  Lets say you've been
  adding, changing, keeping a bunch of files.  Use multi-promote to promote
  them all in a single transaction!  Replace step #10 with "Multi-promote
  files ('mp')".  Use h,j,k,l to navigate and <spacebar> to select.  After
  choosing your elements, use (:wq) to quite and promote.

  Now what?

   That's enough.  Get back to work ;)

   Otherwise, check out |accurev-features| for all commands or
   |accurev-contents| for all available help content

   Enjoy!


===============================================================================
Startup
                                                               *accurev-startup*

Vim automatically loads any plugin files located in its plugin path directories.
By default, the accurev plugin is fully enabled at startup and prompts you
to login if necessary.  The plugin is loaded for each buffer, individually.

If you frequently work on a disconnected network (e.g. airplane mode) or over
a very-slow network connection and don't want to wait for vim to contact
the [unavailable/slow] AccuRev server, you may want to override the default
setting by disabling the plugin on startup.  To enable the plugin on-demand
within vim, a simple key mapping is provided (e.g. '\+').  The plugin can
also be disabled within vim as well (e.g. '\-')

===============================================================================
Settings
                                                             *accurev-settings*

  Of course you can customze this plugin!  There are a few variables at
  the top of the script that allow you to control the behavior of the
  plugin.  Look for the section titled "User Customizations".
  The variables are described in detail below.

  Tip: the accurev.vim script uses extensive |folding|. Be sure to
       "set foldmethod=marker" to more easily navigate the entire script.
       (Use 'zM' to fold the entire script; then 'zo' to open a given fold)

  s:mapleader = "xxx"

      Define the keybinding to used to initiate accurev plugin commands.
      Default value is '\'.  e.g. "accurev add" is "\a" keystroke.

                                                      *accurev-settings-startup*
  s:load_on_startup = [s:true|s:false]

      Determines if the AccuRev plugin is loaded during vim startup.  If enabled,
      the plugin will auto-detect a workspace based on current working directory
      and provide status for the currently loaded file.  Default is s:true.

      Ths flag does NOT prevent bootstrapping which is required for user driven
      load/unload cycles.  Key mapping is available to enable/disable within a
      vim session.  Most people will load on startup.  Disabling is only useful
      for situations such as:

          * accurev not always available (e.g. working on an airplane)
          * slow network causes realtime AccuRev access to slow down vim status refreshes 

  s:graphical_merge_enabled = [s:true|s:false]
   
      Turn on/off launching of AccuRev's graphical merge tool if a merge
      has conflicts and requires human resolution.  If enabled, the
      AccuRev merge tool will be launched.  If disabled, all merges
      must be performed manually outside of vim.  The only practical
      reason to disable is if you are not in a graphical development
      environment or simply prefer traditional text-based merging.
      Default is s:true.

  s:require_comments = [s:true|s:false]
   
      Flag to require non-empty comments during any AccuRev command that
      accepts a user-provided comment including add, keep, promote, etc
      Default is s:true.

  s:show_status_messages = [s:true|s:false]
   
      Turn on/off minimally verbose status messages for the curious user.
      Default is s:false.

  s:plugin_debugging = [s:true|s:false]
    
      Turn on/off plugin debugging.  This feature is designed to display
      minimal critical information during runtime.  Default is s:false.

  s:record_command_history = [s:true|s:false]

      With this flag enabled, the plugin will record all AccuRev CLI calls.
      The history of calls can be viewed in the Command History window ('\?').
      The command history is erased with an AccuRev Logout or when Vim exits.
      Default is s:true.

  s:verbose_command_history = [s:true|s:false]

      With this flag enabled, the return output from each AccuRev CLI call
      is also recorded.  This is only used when recording is enabled (above).
      Be careful - the CLI history is stored in buffer memory and xxxx output is stored in buffer memory
      Default is s:false.

  s:promote_comment_prefix = "..."

      This is a prefix for what is displayed in the promote comment
      for multi-select promote.  Use it to provide a template.

                                         *accurev-settings-enable-issue-promote*
  s:enable_issue_promote = [s:true|s:false]

      This flag determines if the user will be prompted to enter an issue #
      during a promote.   This prompt is global and not specific to any stream
      hierarchy (unlike the CP trigger rules).  For this fact, if this flag
      is enabled, and no issue is necessary, simply press Enter and specifying
      no issue will succeed.  Default is s:false.

                                                         *accurev-not-installed*
   Symptom: AccuRev not installed.
  Solution: Download and install the AccuRev client for you platform.  During
            the wizard install, be sure to install the Client-only; installing
            the server requires a license key.

                  http://www.accurev.com/download


  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                                             *accurev-not-found*
   Symptom: AccuRev client not found.
  Solution: Verify that AccuRev is installed on the machine.  Check the
            following default directory locations:

                Unix: /opt/accurev
             Windows: C:\Program Files\AccuRev

           Next, verify that the accurev executable is in the PATH.

                Unix: echo $PATH   --> ...:/opt/accurev/bin:...
             Windows: echo %PATH%  --> ...;C:\Program Files\AccuRev\bin;...

           If not, set the path to include the below example.

                Unix: $export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/accurev/bin
                      # add to shell startup, e.g. ~/.bashrc, ~/.cshrc
             Windows: $set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\AccuRev\bin
                      # set in system properties under environment variables

     NOTE: For Windows, you may need to set the PATH as a USER or SYSTEM
                 variable in order for the PATH to be visible to the shell.
                      # Start --> Control Panel --> 
        System --> Advanced --> Environment Variables


  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                                           *accurev-unavailable*
   Symptom: AccuRev server unavailable.
  Solution: Check connectivity to the AccuRev server.

            $ accurev info

           If you expect the AccuRev server to be available, contact your
           AccuRev administrator.

           If the server is legitimately unavailable (i.e. working on airplane),
           configure plugin to disable login on startup.

           See |accurev-settings| and |accurev-settings-startup|

                                                      *accurev-not-in-workspace*
   Symptom: Not in a workspace when plugin loads.
  Solution: Verify that the file's directory is within a local directory
            managed by an AccuRev workspace.

           Did you create an AccuRev workspace already?  If not, an
           AccuRev workspace must first be created to 'checkout' the
           source code.  See '$ accurev help mkws' from the CLI.
           
           If you did create a workspace, first check the workspace status.
           From the CLI, cd to the file's directory and run the accurev
           'info' command.  This command will determine if the current
           directory is associated with a workspace.

            $ accurev info

           For a valid workspace, the info output will include values for
           'Workspace/ref', 'Basis', and 'Top' confirming a valid workspace.
           Otherwise, an error indicating 'You are not in a directory associated
           with a workspace' will be displayed.

           If you are not in a workspace but are absolutely sure you created
           a workspace, look at the list of your workspaces known by the
           AccuRev server.  Run '$ accurev show wspaces' to list all workspaces.
           This list will also include the full absolute path to the workspace
           on your machine.  Are you on the right machine?  To move a workspace
           from another machine or directory, see '$ accurev help chws'.

           If you are still sure you created a workspace and it is not in
           the list, look at the removed/hidden workspaces as well.
           Run '$ accurev show -fi wspaces'.  If your workspace is not
           in that list, perhaps you are on the wrong AccuRev server?
           The output from '$ accurev info' will show the server name.

                                                       *accurev-promote-hanging*
   Symptom: Promoting a file hangs with the progress bar showing 1/3 complete.
  Solution: AccuRev may be prompting to enter an issue #.  Currently,
            the plugin supports entering issues but requires setting
            a configuration property.  By default, this is disabled.
            See |accurev-settings-enable-issue-promote|.

   Symptom: Key bindings conflict with another plugin.
  Solution: Simply edit accurev.vim and change the 's:mapleader' variable to a
            new character.
            
            For example, the default leader is '\'

                let s:mapleader = '\'    " configurable
                ...
                map <Leader>a <Plug>AccurevAdd  --[becomes]-->  \a

            Want to use ',' instead?  Sure...

                let s:mapleader = ','    " configurable
                ...
                map <Leader>a <Plug>AccurevAdd  --[becomes]-->  ,a

   Symptom: AccuRev help documentation not loading.
  Solution: Verify that the accurev.txt file is located in the vim /doc
            directory:
            
                     Unix: $HOME/.vim/doc/accurev.txt
                  Windows: %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles\doc\accurev.txt

            Install help documentation by launching Vim and executing:

                     Unix: :helptags ~/.vim/doc
                  Windows: :helptags ~\vimfiles\doc

            Verify that the help docs are available by launching vim then typing
            ":help accurev".

  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                                            *plugin-not-loading*
   Symptom: Plugin is not loading when editing in a workspace
  Solution: First, verify that the plugin is installed.

                     Unix: $HOME/.vim/plugin/accurev.vim
                  Windows: %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles\plugin\accurev.vim

            Second, verify that the working directory is truely an AccuRev
            workspace.  Type "$accurev info" on the command line.  If the message
            "You are in in a directory associated with a workspace" is shown,
            this means the vim plugin is not loading because the edited file is
            not in a workspace.  An AccuRev workspace is needed for the plugin.

            Third, check the "load on startup" property in the
            plugin/accurev.vim file.  if 's:load_on_startup' is set to 's:false',
            the plugin is configured to be  manually loaded.  The default
            keymapping is '/+' for loading and '/-' for unloading.

            Fourth, with the file open in vim, type ":let" and look for the 
            variable "b:accurev_attributes".  The presence of this variable
            indicates that the plugin was found and bootstrapped.  Try to
            enable to AccuRev from within Vim by typing '\+'.  Once enabled
            and logged in, the status bar will display the AccuRev status for
            the file so long as it is in an AccuRev workspace.  If logging in
            shows no status bar, the file is not in an AccuRev workspace.

Tips
                                                                 *accurev-tips*

  Tip #1 - Dealing with a Slow Network or Unavailable AccuRev server
  
      Sometimes over a slow network or VPN, the frequent file status checks
      and refreshing can make the plugin feel sluggish.  In this case, you
      can enable the plugin when you need to perform version control.  The
      plugin can be configured to load on startup for every buffer.  This can
      be controlled with the variable s:load_on_startup located in the
      script.  Optionally, the plugin can be enabled/disabled on-demand
      using \- or \+ respectively.

  Tip #2 - Viewing file history.

      This plugin provides access to element history by either viewing
      the log of keep transactions or viewing per-line change history
      with annotate/blame.  Use '\h' to view the full keep transaction
      history for the current file.  Use '\b' to annotate (blame) the
      file and view commit comments for the most recent changes to a
      highlighted ('l') line.

Plugin Development History
                                                              *accurev-history*

  Why a Vim plugin for AccuRev?   I wrote this plugin for three reasons,
  besides the fact that one didn't exist and I needed one for myself.

    First,
          Vim is the most sophisticated and powerful text editor... ever.
    Second,
          AccuRev is the most sophisticated and powerful SCM tool... ever.
    Third,
          Real programmers use Vim.

  Developing a Vim plugin is no easy task.  It took two weeks to create a few
  prototypes to validate my understanding of the vim programming model and
  feature set.  I refactored the core plugin a few times, finally coming up
  with a stacked MVC-style architecture to support the event-driven nature
  of using buffers.  It was frustrating to spend so much time refactoring the
  core architecture but once I implemented the first few features in what is now
  the "final" architecture, I realized that -every- aspect of a feature
  had a place -- from data access, formatting xml, munging data structures,
  to views for toggleable interfaces.  Furthermore, tracking down bugs was
  super easy because I knew exactly which layer (function) to investigate.
  Having lots of small functions building on each other turned out to be key
  for developing a complex application.  Theory and practice collide!

  Developing this plugin had many challenges.  While the vimscript language
  is fairly powerful, it is very incomplete compared to the community of
  contemporary languages.  For example, lack of a unit test framework and
  xml parsing library have been the most difficult obstacles.  Computers are
  computers so solutions are abound, but effort is certainly required.

  Development Platform
  --------------------
  I developed most of the plugin on a dual-boot Intel Penium M 2.0Ghz/1Gb RAM
  with the following operating systems.  Depending on my mood or need to
  preserve battery power (windows seemed better!?), I would toggle between the
  OS's for development.

    * Ubuntu 6.10, Vim 7.0
    * Windows XP 2002/SP2, Vim 7.0

  Version 1.1 was developed with the following platform:
    * Ubuntu 8.0.4, Vim 7.1.138      [development + testing]
    * Windows XP 2002/SP2, Vim 7.0   [testing]

  Development Log

  waiting at an airport, 30,000+ feet above sea level, or in a hotel room.
  I also spent spare cycles during evenings/weekends at home in Santa Cruz, CA.
